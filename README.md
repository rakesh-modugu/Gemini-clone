ðŸ”¥ Gemini AI Clone ðŸ”¥
Hey there! I'm a recent 2025 graduate passionate about building cool things with new technology. This project is my hands-on exploration of Google's Gemini API, built from scratch using React.js and pure CSS.

This wasn't just about building a "clone"; it was about understanding how to integrate a powerful large language model into a responsive, user-friendly web application. As someone actively seeking a full-stack/frontend role, I'm excited to build projects that are relevant and challenging.

(Definitely add a GIF or screenshot here â€“ it makes a huge difference!)

ðŸš€ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js

Styling: CSS3 (Pure CSS for a lightweight build)

Core AI: Google Gemini API

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useContext)

âœ¨ Features
Real-time AI Chat: Send a prompt and get a response directly from the Gemini API.

Responsive Design: Clean, simple interface that works smoothly on both desktop and mobile.

Chat History: (If you added this) View your previous conversations.

Loading & Error States: Clear feedback for the user while the API is thinking or if something goes wrong.

ðŸ”§ Getting Started
Want to run this on your own machine?

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/rakesh-modugu/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the directory:

Bash

cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Set up your API Key:

Get your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.

Create a .env file in the root of the project.

Add your API key to the .env file:

REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Run the app:

Bash

npm run dev
ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
Building this project was a fantastic learning experience. Here are some of my key takeaways:

Working with APIs: Gained practical experience in making asynchronous API calls to a third-party service, handling request bodies, and parsing JSON responses.

State Management in React: Deepened my understanding of React Hooks, especially for managing chat history, loading states, and user input.

Problem-Solving: Debugging API integrations and managing environment variables securely was a great challenge.

CSS Styling: Honed my skills in creating a clean, modern UI from scratch without relying on a component library.

ðŸ”® Future Goals
This is a solid V1, but I'm always thinking about what's next. Here are a few things I'd love to add:

[ ] Implement a "New Chat" button to clear history.

[ ] Save chat history to localStorage.

[ ] Add a dark mode toggle.

[ ] Use Context API to manage the API key and theme state globally.
